            <h3 class="BioTitle">MY GOALS AS A PROFESSIONAL</h3>
            <article class="BioText">
                <p>One of the questions I get asked often is “Why did you enter into this profession?” My answer varies from person to person, but the core of it never changes. I love what I do. I chose to be a developer very early in my life, putting my first website online nearly twenty years ago (it was a mash of animated gifs and video game walkthroughs.) As I got older, my interests shifted to include the visual arts - In particular film and photography. To me, I find less enjoyment in the expression that the visual fields allow for and more of an interest in the educational capability of the medium. I sought education in graphic design because I felt (and still feel) that it is one of the most powerful ways of conveying messages, concepts, and creating revelation that we as producers can employ.</p>
                <p>I have worn a lot of hats. And I’ve realized the importance of versatility in the field, my long term goal is to understand as much as possible of both the visual creation process as the software creation process. Being able to be work without limits (let them be technological or creatively) is a constant driving force in my personal development. At this point in my career I try to go out of my way to educate others with the knowledge I have learned, and often end up educating myself in the process. The idea of giving back to the community, or the world, is deeply embedded in my inner self; and through this I have formed my ultimate goals, the goal of using design and development as a tool – Not just for industry, but for education and to somehow lessen the suffering of another human being in the process.</p>
